# reactTestTask1
Task was taken from : https://gist.github.com/evgenyrodionov/bbe9b80bebd8e4b7eb868b21c354718e
Instead of that api I used this :  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
There were used next technologies:
React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, SCSS

for launching that task you need only download folder public and run index.html
